# Exercises from Chapter 3

For the following exercises, use the following numbers:

* I~solar~ = 1350 W/m^2^
* $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$
* $\alpha = 0.30$
* $\varepsilon = 1.0$

```{r layer_model_constants}
I_solar = 1350
alpha = 0.30
sigma = 5.67E-8
epsilon = 1
```

## Worked Example for One-Layer Atmosphere

> **A One-Layer Model.** 

```{r one_layer_figure, fig.align=""center"", fig.pos=""htb"", fig.cap = ""An energy diagram for a planet with one pane of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of heat from visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{\\text{solar}} / 4$.""}
make_layer_diagram(1)
```

> a) Write the energy budgets for the atmospheric layer, for the ground, and for
> the Earth as a whole.

**Answer:** Start at the top, at the boundary to space, and work downward:

* At the boundary to space, $I_{1,\text{up}} = (1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} / 4$.

* At the atmospheric layer, $I_{1,\text{up}} + I_{1,\text{down}} = I_{\text{ground},\text{up}}$

* At the ground, $(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} + I_{1,\text{down}} = I_{\text{ground},\text{up}}$

We also know that

* $I_{1,\text{up}} = I_{1,\text{down}} = \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4$

* $I_{\text{ground},\text{up}} = \sigma T_{\text{ground}}^4$


> b) Manipulate the budget for the Earth as a whole to obtain the temperature 
> T~1~ of the atmospheric layer. Does this part of the exercise seem familiar in 
> any way? Does the term ring any bells?

**Answer:** 

$$(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} / 4 = I_{1,\text{up}} = \sigma T_{1}^4$$

$$(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} / 4 \varepsilon \sigma = T_{1}^4$$

$$T_{1} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4 \varepsilon \sigma}}$$

This is familiar, because it's the same as the formula for the bare-rock temperature.

Here is R code to calculate $I_{\text{1,up}}$ and $T_1$:

```{r layer_1_temperature}
I_1_up = (1 - alpha) * I_solar / 4
T_1 = (I_1_up / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25
```

From the algebraic solution, we expect T~1~ to be `r format_md(((1 - alpha) * I_solar / (4 * epsilon * sigma))^0.25, digits = 3)` K.
From the R code above, we get T~1~ = `r format_md(T_1, digits = 3)` K.

> c) Now insert the value you found for T~1~ into the budget for atmospheric 
> layer 1 to obtain the temperature of the ground, T~ground~.

**Answer:** 

* $I_{\text{ground}} = I_{1,\text{up}} + I_{1,\text{down}} = 2 \times I_{1,\text{up}}$
* $\varepsilon \sigma T_{\text{ground}}^4 = 2 \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4$
* $T_{\text{ground}}^4 = 2 T_{1}^4$
* $T_{\text{ground}} = \sqrt[4]{2} \times T_{1}$

And here is R code to calculate $I_{\text{1,down}}$, $I_{\text{ground}}$, and $T_{\text{ground}}$:

```{r ground_temperature}
I_1_down = I_1_up
I_ground = I_1_up + I_1_down
T_ground = (I_ground / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25
```

From the algebraic solution, we get T~ground~ = `r format_md(2^0.25 * T_1, digits = 3)` K and from the R code above, we get T~ground~ = `r format_md(T_ground, digits = 3)` K.

**Answer:** Since the moon has no heat transport, we can consider
I~in~ and I~out~ at the point where the sun is directly overhead, without
worrying about averaging over all of the surface area of the moon.
This means that instead of 
$$ I_{\text{in}} = \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4}, $$
we use
$$ I_{\text{in}} = (1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}, $$

so

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{\text{out}} &= I_{\text{in}} \\
\varepsilon \sigma T_{\text{moon}}^4 &= (1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} \\
T_{\text{moon}}^4 &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{\varepsilon \sigma} \\
T_{\text{moon}} &= \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{\varepsilon \sigma}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r ex_3_1_a}
I_solar = 1350 # W / m^2
albedo = 0.3
emissivity = 1
T_moon = ( (1 - albedo) * I_solar / (emissivity * sigma) )^0.25
```

T~moon~ is `r format_md(T_moon, digits = 2)` Kelvin.

> What is the equilibrium temperature on the dark side of the moon?

**Answer:** 

On the dark side of the moon I~solar~ is zero, so we expect the temperature to be zero.

```{r ex_3_1_b}
I_solar_dark = 0
T_dark_side = ( (1 - albedo) * I_solar_dark / (emissivity * sigma) )^0.25
```

T~dark-side~ = `r format_md(T_dark_side, digits = 2)` Kelvin.

In fact, outer space has a radiation that corresponds to  black body with a 
temperature of around 3 Kelvin. This radiation is heat left over from the 
big bang, almost 14 billion years ago.
Scientists call the the ""Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation,"" and it 
means that empty deep space behaves as though it has a temperature of 3 K.
Thus, in our example we would really expect the dark side of the moon to 
have a temperature of around 3 K.

The real dark side of the moon is cold, but not this cold. 

* First, the moon orbits around the earth, so each side gets sunlight for half 
  of each month and is in darkness for half of each month, so even when it's 
  dark, the surface still has some leftover heat from the last time it was in 
  the sun (it takes a long time to cool all the way from 
  `r format_md(T_moon, digits = 2)` K to 
  `r format_md(T_dark_side, digits = 2)` K). 
* Second, there is a small, but nonzero, flow of heat through the solid moon 
  (this is thermal conduction), so heat does travel from the bright side to the
  dark side. 

These phenomena make the dark side of the moon much warmer than 3 Kelvin, but 
it is still bitterly cold there.

However, the homework explicitly told you to ignore these details, so for the 
purposes of this homework exercise, the correct answer is zero Kelvin.

## Exercise 3.2

> **A Two-Layer Model.** Insert another atmospheric layer into the model, just 
> like the first one. The layer is transparent to visible light but a blackbody 
> for infrared.

```{r two_layer_figure, fig.align=""center"", fig.pos=""htb"", fig.cap = ""An energy diagram for a planet with two panes of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of absorbed visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{\\text{solar}} / 4$.""}
make_layer_diagram(2)
```

> a) Write the energy budgets for both atmospheric layers, for the ground, and 
> for the Earth as a whole, like we did for the One-Layer Model.

**Answer:** 


First, we balance the flow of heat up and down at the imaginary boundary between
the atmosphere and outer space.:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{2,\text{up}} &= (1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} / 4 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The top layer of the atmosphere (layer 2) behaves exactly the way it did in the one-layer
model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{2,\text{in}} &= I_{2,\text{out}} \\
I_{1,\text{up}} &= I_{2,\text{up}} + I_{2,\text{down}} = 2 I_{2,\text{up}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

($I_{2,\text{up}} = I_{2,\text{down}}$ because both are determined by the 
temperature of layer 2, $T_2$, and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation.)

This is essentially the same equation we used for the heat balance of the 
atmosphere in the one-layer model.


The heat-balance for the lower layer of the atmosphere is a little more
complicated because there are two sources of heat in:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{1,\text{in}} &= I_{1,\text{out}} \\
I_{\text{ground},\text{up}} +  I_{2,\text{down}} &= I_{1,\text{up}} + I_{1,\text{down}} = 2 I_{1,\text{up}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the heat balance for the ground is

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{\text{ground},\text{in}} &= I_{\text{ground},\text{out}} \\
\frac{(1 - \alpha ) I_{\text{solar}}}{4} + I_{\text{1},\text{down}} &=
I_{2,\text{up}} + I_{2,\text{down}}  = 2 I_{2,\text{up}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$


> b) Manipulate the budget for the Earth as a whole to obtain the temperature 
> T~2~ of the top atmospheric layer, labeled Atmospheric Layer 2 in the figure 
> above. Does this part of the exercise seem familiar in any way? Does the term 
> ring any bells?

**Answer:** 

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{2,\text{up}} &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4} \\
\sigma T_2^4 &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4} \\
T_2^4 &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4 \sigma} \\
T_2 &= \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4 \sigma}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$



```{r ex_3_2_b}
T_2 = ( (1 - albedo) * I_solar / (4 * sigma) )^0.25
```
This is just like the one-layer model, and we get the same bare-rock temperature for the top of the atmosphere:
T~2~ = `r format_md(T_2, digits = 2)` Kelvin.

> c) Insert the value you found for T~2~ into the energy budget for layer 2, and 
> solve for the temperature of layer 1 in terms of layer 2. How much bigger is 
> T~1~ than T~2~?

**Answer:** 

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{2,\text{in}} &= I_{2,\text{out}} \\
I_{1,\text{up}} &= I_{2,\text{up}} + I_{2,\text{down}} = 2 I_{2,\text{up}} \\
\sigma T_1^4 &= 2 \sigma T_2^4 \\
T_1^4 &= 2 T_2^4 \\
T_1 &= \sqrt[4]{2}~T_2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$



```{r ex_3_2_c}
T_1 = 2^0.25 * T_2
```

This gives layer 1 the same temperature that the ground had in the one-layer model: 
T~1~ = `r format_md(T_1, digits = 2)`, 
which is $\sqrt[4]{2} = `r format_md(2^0.25, digits = 3)`$ times bigger than T~2~.

> d) Now insert the value you found for T~1~ into the budget for atmospheric 
> layer 1 to obtain the temperature of the ground, T~ground~. Is the greenhouse 
> effect stronger or weaker because of the second layer?


**Answer:** 

This gets a little more complicated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{1,\text{in}} &= I_{1,\text{out}} \\
I_{\text{ground},\text{up}} +  I_{2,\text{down}} &= I_{1,\text{up}} + I_{1,\text{down}} = 2 I_{1,\text{up}} \\
\sigma T_{\text{ground}}^4 + \sigma T_2^4 &= 2 \sigma T_1^4 \\
T_{\text{ground}}^4 + T_2^4 &= 2 T_1^4 \\
T_{\text{ground}}^4 &= 2 T_1^4 - T_2^4 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
But $T_1^4 = 2 T_2^4$, so 
$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{\text{ground}}^4 &= 4 T_2^4 - T_2^4 = 3 T_2^4 \\
T_{\text{ground}} &= \sqrt[4]{3}~T_2^4 \\
\end{aligned}
$$


```{r ex_3_2_d}
T_ground = 3^0.25 * T_2
```

Thus, the ground temperature in the two-layer model is 
`r format_md(T_ground, digits = 2)` Kelvin.
This is `r format_md(T_ground - T_1, digits=1)` Kelvin hotter than the 
ground was in the one-layer model, so adding another layer made the greenhouse
effect stronger.

## Exercise 3.3

```{r nuclear_winter_diagram, fig.align=""center"", fig.pos=""htb"", fig.cap=""An energy diagram for a planet with an opaque pane of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of absorbed visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{\\text{solar}} / 4$.""}
make_nuclear_winter_diagram()
```

> **Nuclear Winter.** Let us go back to the One-Layer Model but change it so 
> that the atmospheric layer absorbs visible light rather than allowing it to 
> pass through (See the figure above). This could happen if the upper atmosphere 
> were filled with dust. For simplicity, assume that the albedo of the Earth 
> remains the same, even though in the real world it might change with a dusty 
> atmosphere.>  What is the temperature of the ground in this case?

**Answer:**

We start, as always, by balancing the energy. Just as in all of the other 
layer models, the temperature of the top layer of the atmosphere 
(the dusty layer) is the basic bare-rock temperature (because the dust doesn't 
change the albedo in this problem).

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{\text{atm},\text{up}} &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4} \\
\sigma T_1^4 &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4} \\
T_1^4 &= \frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4 \sigma} \\
T_1 &= \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4 \sigma}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

What's new is that when we balance the heat flow in the dusty atmosphere, we 
have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{\text{atm},\text{in}} &= I_{\text{atm},\text{out}} \\
\frac{((1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}}}{4} + I_{\text{ground},\text{up}} &= 
I_{\text{atm},\text{up}} + I_{\text{atm},\text{down}} = 2 I_{\text{atm},\text{up}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
We could just put numbers in and solve for $T_{\text{ground}}$, but if we remember
that 
$$
\frac{ (1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} }{4} = I_{\text{atm},\text{up}}
$$
we can substitute
$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{\text{atm},\text{up}} + I_{\text{ground},\text{up}} &= 2 I_{\text{atm},\text{up}} \\
I_{\text{ground},\text{up}} &= I_{\text{atm},\text{up}} \\
\sigma T_{\text{ground}}^4 &= \sigma T_{\text{atm}}^4 \\
T_{\text{ground}} &= T_{\text{atm}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r ex_3_3}
T_atm = ( (1 - albedo) * I_solar / (4 * sigma) )^0.25
T_ground = T_atm
```

So the ground temperature will be `r format_md(T_ground, digits = 2)` K, 
the same as the temperature of the atmosphere, which is the bare-rock
temperature, so there is no greenhouse effect.
