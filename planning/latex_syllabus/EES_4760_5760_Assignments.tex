\begin{itemize}
\item
  Do the assigned reading \emph{before\/} you come to class on the date
  for which it is assigned. If you have questions or find the ideas
  presented in the readings confusing, I encourage you to ask questions
  in class.
\item
  Download the list of errata for the textbook from
  \url{https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/Railsback_Grimm_2012_Errata.pdf}.
\item
  Questions in the ``Reading Notes'' sections of the assignments are for
  you to think about to make sure you understand the material, but you
  do not have to write up your answers or turn them in.

  You are responsible for all the assigned readings, but topics I have
  highlighted in the reading notes are particularly important.
\item
  In addition to the questions I ask in the reading notes, look over the
  ``Conclusions'' section at the end of each chapter in
  \emph{Agent-Based Modeling} to check whether you understand the key
  facts and concepts from the chapter.

\subsubsection{Reading Notes:}\label{reading-notes}}

This reading sets the stage for answering the questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is computational modeling and why is it useful in social and
  natural science research?
\item
  What are agent based models? How are they different from other kinds
  of models? What makes them useful for scientific research?
\end{enumerate}

The reading introduces the idea of a \textbf{modeling cycle}. You should
understand the different steps in the modeling cycle. You should also
think about why Railsback and Grimm describe modeling as a cycle, as
opposed to a linear process with a start and stop.

As to what makes agent-based modeling special, Steven Railsback and
Volker Grimm are ecologists and \emph{Agent-Based Modeling} emphasizes
aspects of agent-based modeling that are well suited for studying
ecological systems. Others, such as social scientists, emphasize the
aspects of agent-based modeling that are well suited for problems in
social science. And still others, such as computer scientists, emphasize
aspects of automated and autonomous things (ranging from packets of data
on a network to swarms of robots or flying drones that need to
coordinate their activities and avoid collisions). What all of these
approaches have in common are their use of individuals or
\textbf{agents} (what is an agent?), which inhabit some kind of space or
\textbf{environment} (this could be physical space or an abstract space,
such as a computer network). Agents \textbf{interact} with each other
and with the environment, and they make \textbf{decisions} according to
rules.

The article ``Artificial Life'' gives you a feel for how an early
agent-based model called ``Sugarscape'' was used as part of a very
influential research project in the 1990s. Joshua Epstein and Robert
Axtell who wrote Sugarscape are highly respected pioneers in agent-based
modeling and the Sugarscape model set off a revolution in agent-based
modeling by showing that a very simple model could reproduce complex
phenomena that are observed in real societies. As you read through this
article, think about what the different applications of agent-based
models have in common. Do these suggest questions that you might be
interested in exploring with agent-based models. Do you have questions,
as you read this, about whether computer modeling can really tell you
about real societies?

Agent-based models are often used to examine \textbf{emergent}
phenomena. Neither reading describes clearly what \emph{emergence}
means. There is no simple definition, but during the semester we will
pay a lot of attention to learning about emergence and trying to
understand it. Do not worry if you don't understand emergence at this
point. Emergence is difficult to put into words, and it's much easier to
understand from experience. Over the course of the semester, we will
work together to understand what emergence is and how to study it.

Turn in the following homework on Box by 11:59 pm:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As you read along with Section 2.3, follow along on your computer and
  build the \emph{Mushroom Hunt} model by typing in the code shown in
  the textbook. The whole program is shown on pages 28--29. \textbf{Save
  your model as \texttt{mushroom\_hunt.nlogo}}.

  This exercise may seem very simple, but it is the first step toward
  learning how to program NetLogo and it will be an important first step
  toward writing your own models.

  After you are done typing in your model, try running it.

  \textbf{When you are done, make a subfolder called \texttt{HW\_2} in
  your Box folder for this class, and upload your model.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{notes-on-homework}{%
\subsubsection{Notes on Homework:}\label{notes-on-homework}}

I recommend getting together with a classmate and working together on
this assignment. Since the assignment consists of typing code in and
running it, do not worry about your work being identical to your
partner's. However, I strongly recommend that you type everything in
yourself because you will not learn if you just copy someone else's code
or download the code from a source on the web.

If you run into trouble and cannot make your model work, do not worry.
Ask a classmate for help, or email me (and attach your \texttt{.nlogo}
model file), or simply come to class on Tuesday with questions about the
problems you had getting your model to work. Since your model file will
be on Box, we will be able to discuss the problems in class.

Familiarize yourself with NetLogo. I recommend that you read through the
chapter with NetLogo open on your computer. Feel free to play around
with NetLogo and try things out. The homework consists of following the
step-by-step creation of a model in section 2.3.

\textbf{Errata for chapter 2:}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  On page 20, after you add the \texttt{setup} and \texttt{go} buttons
  to the interface, but before you write the \texttt{go} procedure, when
  you click the ``Check'' button, it will take you to the interface page
  because the \texttt{go} button has an eror: the procedure \texttt{go}
  does not exist yet. After you write the \texttt{go} procedure in the
  Code tab, then the Check button will work as described in the book.
\item
  The first bullet on page 21 should read:

  \begin{itemize}

  the bulleted list in Ex. 2.4. Save each model with a new name, such as
  \texttt{ex\_2\_4a.nlogo}, \texttt{ex\_2\_4b.nlogo}, \dots,
  \texttt{ex\_2\_4g.nlogo}
\item

  Write your answers in any convenient text format (a simple text file,
  a Word document, a \texttt{.pdf} file, or whatever suits you). Call
  the file \texttt{ex\_3\_3.docx} (or \texttt{ex\_3\_3.pdf}, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{notes-on-homework-1}{%
\subsubsection{Notes on Homework:}\label{notes-on-homework-1}}

My advice for Chapter 3, Exercise 3 is don't be too ambitious with your
model, but keep it very simple. Don't worry about getting everything
right. If there are things you don't feel sure about or don't know how
to express, you should just write a parenthetical note in your ODD
document commenting on your difficulty. Come to class prepared to talk
about how this exercise went and where you felt confused about trying to
specify your model.

As always, I recommend working with another classmate or in a group,
comparing your different ways of approaching the exercises, and
discussing any difficulties together.

For the reading, read Chapter 4 in \emph{Agent-Based Modeling} first and
focus mostly on this chapter.

It is worth noting that the Sugarscape model you read about for Jan.~11
is very similar to the hilltopping model. Sugarscape was part of a very
influential research project in the 1990s, in which Joshua Epstein and
Robert Axtell showed that a very simple model could reproduce complex
biological and economic phenomena that are observed in real societies
and ecosystems. You may find it interesting at this point to look back
at the ``Artificial Societies'' article and to play with the Sugarscape
model in NetLogo.

You can downlload an
\href{/files/models/chapter_04/butterfly_model_ODD.txt}{ODD for the
butterfly model}, which is suitable to paste into the ``Info'' tab in

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{reading-notes-4}{%
\subsubsection{Reading Notes:}\label{reading-notes-4}}

This reading sets the stage for answering the big question, ``How can we
use agent-based models to do science?'' There are several aspects to
this question, which this chapter will introduce:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How can we produce quantitative output from our models?
\item
  How can your models read and write data to and from files? (This is
  important for connecting your model to other parts of your project)
\item
  How should we test our models to make sure they do what we think they
  do? (More on this in Chapter 6)
\item
  Making your research reproducible by using version control and
  documentation.
\end{enumerate}

A number of you like to use Excel or statistical analysis tools, such as
\texttt{R}, \texttt{SPSS}, or \texttt{Stata}. The material in this
chapter about importing and exporting data using text or \texttt{.csv}
files will be very useful for this. By default, NetLogo only allows you
to read in data in simple text files. However, if comes with some
extensions that you can use to read in data from other common file
formats, including \texttt{.csv} and ArcGIS shapefiles and raster (grid)
files.

If you want to read in data from csv files, you may want to look at the
documentation for the \texttt{csv} extension to NetLogo. To use it, you
just put the line \texttt{includes\ {[}csv{]}} as the first line of your
model, and then use functions from the extension, such as
\texttt{let\ data\ csv:from-file\ "myfile.csv"}.

To read in date from ArcGIS files, look at the documentation for the
\texttt{GIS} extension. You would put the line
\texttt{extensions\ {[}\ gis\ {]}} as the first line of your model, and
then use functions, such as \texttt{gis:load-dataset}, which can load
vector shape files (\texttt{.shp}) and raster grid files (\texttt{.grd}
or \texttt{.asc}). The GIS extension offers a lot of functions for
working with vector and raster GIS data. If you're interested in using
GIS data in your models, take a look at the GIS examples in the NetLogo
model library.

You can download the
\href{/files/models/chapter_05/ElevationData.txt}{data file} with the
elevations for the realistic butterfly model from
\url{https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/models/chapter_05/ElevationData.txt}

\textbf{Errata for Chapter 5:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Page 68: Replace the statement

\begin{verbatim}
export-plot "Corridor width"
    word "Corridor-output-for-q-" q
\end{verbatim}

  with this:

\begin{verbatim}
export-plot "Corridor width"
    (word "Corridor-output-for-q-" q ".csv")
\end{verbatim}

  The revised statement appends the file extension ``\texttt{.csv}'' to
  the file name created via the \texttt{word} primitive. Note that when
  \texttt{word} is used to concatenate more than two values tovether, it
  and all the values must be inside parentheses.

No one writes perfect programs. Errors in programs controlling medical
equipment have killed people. Errors in computer models and data
analysis code have not had such dire results, but have wasted lots of
time for researchers and have caused public policy to proceed on
incorrect assumptions. In many cases, these errors were uncovered only
after a great deal of frustration because the original researchers would
not share their computer codes with others who were suspicious of their
results.

You can never be certain that your model is correct, but the more
aggressively you check for errors the more confident you can be that it
does not have major problems.

Two very important things you can do to ensure that your research does
not suffer a similar fate are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Test your code. Assume your program has errors in it and make the
  search for those errors a priority in your programming process. Some
  things you can do in this regard are:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Write your code with tests that will help you find errors.
  \item
    Work with a partner: after one of you writes code, the other should
    read it and check for errors.
  \item
    Break your program up into small chunks. It is easier to test and
    find bugs if you are looking at a short block of code than if you
    are looking at hundreds of lines of code.
  \item
    Independently reimplement submodels and check whether they agree
    with the submodel you are using.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Publish your code. If you trust your results and believe they are
  important enough to publish in a book or journal, then you should make
  your code available (there are many free sites, such as github.com and
  openabm.org where people can publish their models and other computer
  code).

  The more that other researchers can read your code, the greater the
  probability that they will find any errors, and if you make it easy
  for others to use your code, it will help science because other people
  can build on your work, and it will help your reputation because when
  other people use your model or other code they are likely to cite the
  publication in which you first announced it, so your work will get
  attention.

  Many scholarly journals demand that you make your code available as a
  condition for publishing your paper, and federal funding agencies are
  increasingly requiring that any research funded by their grants must
  make its code and data available to other researchers and the public.

  Section 6.3.7, in the example \texttt{test} procesure: The syntax of
  the \texttt{foreach} statement changed, starting with NetLogo version
  6.0. This was because NetLogo introduced a new feature, called
  ``anonymous procedures,'' which you can read about in the NetLogo User
  Manual. This means that we need to change the code in the book for the
  \texttt{go-back} test procedure. The new procedure should read:

\begin{verbatim}

There is not very much reading for today. Read Chapter 7 of
\emph{Agent-Based Modeling} carefully (it's very short) The point of
this chapter is to help you get ideas for your term research project.

Before class, I want you to read through the research project assignment
and think about what you might want to do for a research project. We
will spend class talking about possible research projects.

This is a major chapter. Emergence is one of the most important concepts
in agent-based modeling, so pay close attention to the discussion in
this chapter and think about how you can measure and assess emergence.

This chapter also introduces a very important tool for doing experiments
in NetLogo: \textbf{BehaviorSpace}. BehaviorSpace lets you repeatedly
run a NetLogo model while varying the settings of any of the controls on
your user interface. Where there is randomness (stochasticity) in the
model, you can perform many runs at each set of control settings. This
will let us perform \textbf{sensitivity analysis} to determine whether a
certain emergent phenomenon we are investigating happens only for values
of the parameters within a narrow range, or whether it happens over a
wide range of the parameters. It will let us determine which parameters
are most important for the phenomenon.

For homework and your modeling projects you will use BehaviorSpace
extensively. BehaviorSpace outputs large amounts of data to
\texttt{.csv} files, which you can read into Excel, R, SPSS, or another
tool where you can do statistical analysis and generate plots such as
the ones in figures 8.3, 8.5, and 8.6.

The format in which BehaviorSpace saves its data is very annoying to
deal with in many tools. Indeed, it's almost impossible to do anything
useful with it in Excel. Because of this, I have written a tool called
\texttt{analyzeBehaviorspace} that can read the output of a
BehaviorSpace run and allow you to interactively graph it and
re-organize the data to make it more useful.

You can either use this tool online in a web browser at
\url{https://analyze-behaviorspace.jgilligan.org} or install it on your
own computer. For details, see the description of
\texttt{analyzeBehaviorspace} on the ``Reading Resources and Computing
Tools for Research'' handout.

As you read the chapter, be sure to try out the experiments with the
birth-and-death model and the flocking model. Try reading the output of
the behaviorspace runs into analyzeBehaviorspace (the web version or a
local version installed on your computer), or your favorite statistical
analysis software and try to generate plots similar to figures 8.3, 8.5,
and 8.6.

If you have time, try to play around with BehaviorSpace using those
models (varying different parameters) or other models from the NetLogo
library to explore the ways that changing parameters affects the models'
behavior.

  primitive. For example, add this statement:

\begin{verbatim}

    (max [elevation] of turtles)

  Or, if the histogram should always start at zero:

\begin{verbatim}
set-plot-x-range 0 max [elevation] of turtles

Important programming concepts in this chapter include:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Links:]
Agents interact with their physical environment (patches around them)
and with other agents nearby, but they can also interact in social
networks, which can be represented by links.
\item[Variable scope:]
Understand the differences between global variables, local variables,
patch variables, agent variables, and link variables. Understand how an
agent can get the value of a global variable or variables belonging to a
certain patch or link or another agent.
\item[Entity detection:]
Understand different ways to detect which agents or patches meet certain
conditions (e.g., within a certain distance, have a certain color, have
the largest or smallest values of some variable, etc.).
\end{description}

The agents' interactions, both with their environment and with each
other through sensing. Part of the design concepts section of a model's
ODD consists of specifying what the agents can sense: They might be able
to sense other agents within a certain distance. They might only be able
to detect other agents if they are within a certain angle (e.g., the
agent might be able to look forward, but might not be able to see behind
itself unless it turns around). Agents might be able to detect certain
qualities of one another (e.g., I can see how tall you are, but I can't
see how much money you have).

Agents can interact both spatially and through networks of links. You
can create many kinds of links so that agents can belong to many
networks (e.g., family, co-workers, members of a church congregation,
etc.).

Sensing involves two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Detect which entities your agent (or patch) will sense.
\item
  Get the values of the sensed variables from those entities.
\end{enumerate}

Be sure to code the Business Investor model as you read section 10.4.
You will use it in Chapter 11 and it will form the basis for one of the
team projects you will present. The other team project will use the

and your teammates to get started on your team projects.

Agents' behavior often consists of trying to achieve some
\textbf{objective}.

I have discussed the way that Adam Smith's ``invisible hand of the
market'' is a kind of agent-based view of a nation's economy: Each
person (agent) has an objective of trying to maximize his or her own
wealth (that's the agent's \textbf{micromotive}), and in doing so, the
population of agents manages unintentionally to maximize the total
wealth of the nation (an emergent \textbf{macrobehavior} that results
from the collective interactions of the agents and their micromotives).

For Darwin, agents whose objectives are to survive and reproduce under
changing environmental conditions achieve emergent phenomena of
evolution and speciation.

If we are going to program an agent-based model to simulate such an
economy (we saw this in the Sugarscape models), you need to program your
agents to try to achieve their objective (maximize their wealth). There
are two approaches to this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  You could program a sophisticated strategy into your agents.
\item
  You could program a simple strategy into your agents, but give them
  the ability to learn from their experience and adapt their behavior
  according to what they learn. (see section 11.3 for details and an
  example)
\end{enumerate}

This chapter discusses different kinds of objectives you might have your
agents employ. An important concept from decision theory and behavioral
economics that might be new to you is \textbf{satisficing}. This term,
introduced by Herbert Simon\footnote{Herbert Simon (1916--2001) was a
  fascinating intellectual. Kind of a renaissance scholar, he made major
  contributions to political science, economics, cognitive psychology,
  and artificial intelligence. He won the Nobel Prize for economics in
  1978. His publications have been cited more than 250,000 times and
  even fifteen years after his death, they are still cited more than
  10,000 times per year.} in 1956, refers to making decisions by
choosing a ``good-enough'' option when it would take too much time and
effort to determine which option is the absolute best. See section 11.4
for details and an example.

  it assumes ages are real numbers instead of integers. It should read:

  \_The social status of a dog can be (a) ``pup,'' meaning its age is
  less than one;

  \begin{enumerate}

    is 2 or greater but the dog is not an alpha; (d) ``alpha,'' the
    dominant individual of its sex in a pack; and (e) ``disperser,''
    meaning the dog currently belongs to a disperser group, not a
    pack.\_
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Section 16.4.1, p.~213: The first bullet of the description of pack
  formation should start ``Determine how many times the disperser group
  meets another\ldots{}''
\item
  Section 16.4.1, Fig. 16.1: Be aware that this figure does not depict
  the logistic function parameters in the Wild Dog model description.
  The figure shows a probability of 0.5 when the number of dogs in the
  population is 67\% of carrying capacity (40 out of 60), while the
  model description says the probability is 0.5 when the population is
  50\% of carrying capacity. To match the model description, the
  figure's curve should go through X = 30, Y = 0.5.
\item
  Section 16.4.2, p.~217: Setting the dog's variable \texttt{my-pack} to
  the pack that created it (via the statement
  \texttt{set\ my-pack\ myself}) can cause a subtle error in the pack
  formation submodel. Disperser groups cannot form a pack with other
  disperser groups that originated in the same pack. In most people's
  code, disperser groups use the value of \texttt{my-pack} from one of
  their dogs to determine which pack they came from. The error can occur
  when two disperser groups came from packs that have since died; when a
  disperser dog's pack dies, NetLogo automatically changes its value of
  \texttt{my-pack} to the keyword \texttt{nobody}. Because disperser
  groups cannot form a new pack with another group that has the same
  value of \texttt{my-pack}, groups whose packs have died cannot combine
  with each other, even if they really came from two different packs. A
  solution is to set \texttt{my-pack} to the unique \texttt{who} number
  of the dog's pack. Instead of \texttt{set\ my-pack\ myself}, use
  \texttt{set\ my-pack\ {[}who{]}\ of\ myself}. Use a similar statement
  when new dogs are created in the reproduction submodel. Then change
  the statements where a dog's value of \texttt{my-pack} is compared to
  a pack, from (for example):

\begin{verbatim}
set pack-members dogs with [my-pack = myself]
\end{verbatim}

  to:

\begin{verbatim}
set pack-members dogs with [my-pack = [who] of myself]
\end{verbatim}

  And because \texttt{my-pack} now contains a who number instead of a
  pack, one of the last lines in the
  \texttt{create-disperser-group-from} code (page 220) needs to be
  changed, from:

\begin{verbatim}
ask dogs-former-pack [set pack-members ... 
\end{verbatim}

  to:

\begin{verbatim}
ask pack dogs-former-pack [set pack-members ...
\end{verbatim}

  This error appears to have little effect on model results.

\textbf{Errata for Chapter 20:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Section 20.5, p.~264: The first bullet of the description of the
  simple trait for how subordinate adults decide whether to scout should
  say, ``If there are no \emph{older} subordinate adults'' instead of
  ``other subordinate adults''.
\item
  Section 20.7, Exercise 2: The model equation has parentheses in the
  wrong place. It should be:
  \[ N_t = N_{t-1} + r N_{t-1} [ 1 - (N_{t-1} / K)] - H_{t-1}\]
