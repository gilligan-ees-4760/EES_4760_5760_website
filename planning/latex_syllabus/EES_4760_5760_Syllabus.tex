\section[Description]{Course Description}
\subsection{Catalog Description}
\textbf{\ShortCourseName.} Applications in natural, social, and behavioral
sciences and engineering. Designing, programming, and documenting models.
Using models for experiments. Examples from environmental science, ecology,
economics, urban planning, and medicine. Familiarity with basic statistics and
proficiency in algebra are expected.
[3] (MNS)

\subsection{Narrative Description}
Agent-based and individual-based modeling has become a powerful tool for
research in many fields, including anthropology, civil engineering,
computer science, ecology, economics, epidemiology, marketing, medicine,
political science, public policy, robotics, sociology, transportation, and
urban planning.

Agent-based modeling is used to study how individual agents (which can represent
people, animals, plants, cars, robots, or packets of information in a
communications network) making simple decisions can produce complex and
unexpected collective behavior through their interactions. Agent-based models
have been used to investigate racial segregation in American cities, traffic
jams, adaptation to global warming, disease outbreaks, inflammatory response to
wound infections, ecosystem dynamics, impacts of changing land-use on tropical
rain forests, political instability, and market penetration of home solar-energy
systems.

This course will provide an introduction to agent and individual-based modeling.
You will learn how to design, program, and document agent-based computational
models using the free open-source \NetLogo\ environment. You will use these
models scientifically to perform computational experiments and interpret the
results.

You do not need to have any prior knowledge of computer programming, but I do
expect that you are familiar with basic statistics and algebra.
We will use the \NetLogo\ environment for writing and running agent-based models.
\NetLogo\ is a widely used system that is both powerful and easy to learn, so
you can quickly start to program your own models.

\iffalse
\section[Goals]{Goals for the Course}
My goals for this course are that at the end of the semester:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
\end{itemize}
\fi
%
%
%
%\clearpage
\section[Structure]{Structure of the Course:}
I divide the semester into three parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction to Agent-Based Models and \NetLogo:} The first
    part of the course introduces the basic concepts of computer modeling, what
    agent-based models are, and how to use the \NetLogo\ environment to write
    and run simple agent based models. I do not assume any prior experience with
    programming or computer modeling, so this part of the course will give you
    everything you need to get started.
    \item \textbf{Designing Agent-Based Models:} Next, we study the essential
    components of agent-based models and develop a systematic approach to
    designing and implementing agent-based models that will be suitable for
    doing real science. This section will use examples of real agent-based
    models that have been used for published research.
    \item \textbf{Using Models for Serious Research:} After mastering the
    components that good models should have, we step back from the details and
    work at a more strategic level to consider how we can design  and use models
    to answer research questions in social and natural sciences.
%    In this section, you will work on projects to design and program your own
%    model, use it for computational experiments, and analyze and interpret the
%    results.
\end{enumerate}
%
%
%
\pagebreak
\subsection{Reading Material}
There is one required textbook.
From time to time during the term, I will assign supplementary reading on the
Internet or in handouts that I will post to the class web site.

\subsubsection{Textbooks}
\begin{itemize}
	%
	\item \LongRailsback.
	% \item \LongGrowing
\end{itemize}

There is a companion web site to \emph{\Railsback}, \RailsbackURL, that has
additional useful information.

All textbooks have errors. The authors maintain a list of errors that have been
reported to them and you can download it from the book's web site at
\RailsbackURL\ or from the course web site at
\url{https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/Railsback_Grimm_2012_Errata.pdf}.

You can download the \NetLogo\ program from \NetLogoURL. It runs on Windows,
Mac, and Linux systems.

\subsubsection{Additional Resources}
This course only scratches the surface of what is possible with agent-based
models, and what researchers are doing with them.
I have prepared a separate handout on additional reading and computational
resources for doing research with agent-based models.
This handout lists a number of helpful books, journals, web sites, and software
tools that you may find useful or interesting if your want to learn more.

\subsubsection{Class Web Site}
In addition to Brightspace,
I have set up a server at \url{https://ees4760.jgilligan.org}, where I post the
web versions of class slides and interactive web-based applications to that can
be useful for working with data output from agent-based modeling experiments.

\subsubsection{Overview of reading assignments}
I will give out detailed reading that give specific pages to read for each class
and notes on important things you should understand.
\textbf{I expect you to complete the reading before you come to class on the day
for which the reading is assigned}, so you can participate in discussions of the
assigned material and ask questions if there are things you don't understand.

\subsection{Computer Software}
For this class, we will write and execute agent-based models using the \NetLogo\
modeling system. NetLogo is free software developed at Northwestern University.
You can download it from \url{https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/}.
\NetLogo\ is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
I have chosen it for this course because it is free, it runs on all the major
operating systems, its programming language is very easy to learn; and it allows
you to easily create a visual representation of your model.

You should download \NetLogo\ version 6.0.2 from
\url{http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml}
and install it on your computer.

\NetLogo\ has been used widely both for education and also for research-grade
modeling. However, no computer software is perfect and for some large or
complicated models, NetLogo may be inadequate.
There are a number of other
open-source agent-based modeling systems that are more powerful than \NetLogo\
and are better suited for large and complex models. However, these systems are
much harder to learn and much harder for even experts to write models in.
My experience is that for most modeling projects, you can get more done in a
week with \NetLogo\ than in a month or more with the other systems I know of.

\subsubsection[Grading]{Basis for Grading}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[t]{crr}
		Class participation & 5\% &\\
		Homework & 25\% &\\
		Assigned Projects & 30\% &\\
		Research Project & 40\% &
%    Feedback to Other Students & 5\%
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{\scshape Note:} Graduate student research projects will involve
additional requirements and a longer final report than undergraduate projects,
and graduate students will be assigned more homework exercises.

\subsubsection{Homework}
You will set up a Box folder for this course at \url{https://vanderbilt.box.com}
and share it with me.
Homework must be turned in electronically via the Box folder
before class on the day it is due.
%
\subsubsection{Projects}
You will do assigned team projects and one research project.
On the team projects you will work with a partner or a small team to program
and work with models.
% You will do two assigned modeling projects and one research project.
% Each modeling project will entail writing an ODD document for the model,
% programming a model following the ODD specification you have written,
run experiments with the model, write up the results, and make a short
presentation to the class.

For your research project, you will study an existing model, adapt it to
investigate a new research question, run and analyze experiments using the
model, write up the results, and make a presentation to the class.
%, but you will be paired with other students with whom you will exchange
% feedback as you develop your project.

\subsubsection{Tests and Examinations}
There will not be any tests or examinations in this course. Your grade will be
based on class participation, homework, modeling projects, and in-class
presentations.

%
% You may take either the regular or the alternate final exam (but not both).
% You must tell me in advance which exam you will take. I will pass a sign-up
% sheet in class during the last week of classes to sign up for which exam you
% will take. If you do not choose on the sign-up sheet, you must take the
% regular exam on \FinalExamDay, \FinalExamMonth.~\FinalExamDate.
% \else
% There will not be an alternate final exam.
% \fi
%
% The final exam will be cumulative over all the material covered during the term.

\section{Honor Code:}
This course, like all courses at Vanderbilt, is conducted under the Honor Code.
\begin{description}
\item[Studying:] As you study for this class, I encourage you to to seek help from me%
\ifTA
, from \TaTitle,
\else
\
\fi
or from other classmates or friends.

\item[Homework Assignments:] I encourage working together
on homework assignments: you may talk with your friends and classmates about
homework assignments, compare notes on how you are working a problem, and you
may look at your classmates' work on homework assignments.
But you must work through the problems yourself
in the work you turn in:
\textbf{Even if you have discussed the solution with others you must work
through the steps yourself and express the answers in your own words. You may
not simply copy someone else's answer.}

\item[Team Assignments:] On some assignments, in which I explicitly direct you
to work with others.
These team assignments will contain instructions how the honor code applies.

\item[Research Project:] The research project assignment will contain details
about how the honor code applies to the research project.
\end{description}

If you ever
have questions about how the Honor Code applies to your work
in this course, please ask me.
\textbf{Uncertainty about the Honor Code does not excuse a violation.}
\section{Final Note:}
I have made every effort to plan a busy, exciting, and instructive semester.
I may find during the term that I need to revise the syllabus to give more time
to some subjects or to pass more quickly over others rather than covering them
in depth.
Thus, while I will attempt to follow this syllabus as closely as I can,
you should realize that it is subject to change during the semester.
