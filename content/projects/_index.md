## Team Projects

Your write-up will be due on to Brighspace by 11:59 pm on Friday, Oct. 22.

### ODDs:

* Business Investor Model:
  * [Online](/projects/business_investor_odd)
  * [Printable PDF](/files/odd/business_investor_odd.pdf)
  * [Text file](/files/odd/business_investor_odd.md) that you can paste into 
    the "info" tab in your NetLogo model.
* Telemarketer Model:
  * [Online](/projects/telemarketer_odd)
  * [Printable PDF](/files/odd/telemarketer_odd.pdf)
  * [Text file](/files/odd/telemarketer_odd.md) that you can paste into the 
    "info" tab in your NetLogo model.

### Teams:

Originally, when I set the assignments for the team projects, this table and 
the PDF assignments had assigned all of the teams to do the same exercises:
  * The Business Investor teams were assigned exercises 10.3 and 10.4 
  * The Telemarketer teams were assigned exercises 13.2, 13.6, and 13.8
  
I forgot to update this assignment table when I assigned the teams on 
Brightspace and assigned different exercises there. 

On October 12, I updated this web site to match the table on Brightspace, but 
if you already started working on the original exercises, you may stick with 
the original for full credit. 
I don't want you to suffer for my mistake in not keeping the assignments on 
this web site synchronized with the assignments on Brightspace.

But if you have not already started on the exercises, I would recommend doing
the ones assigned here. Especially if you are working on the telemarketer
model, I have mixed the exercises up so that each team will do a different set
of exercises, so the presentations will be more diverse.

Regardless, you will get full credit whether your team does the updated 
assignment given here or the original assignment.
