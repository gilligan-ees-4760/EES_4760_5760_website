### In-Class Presentations:

> For class on Wednesday October 9, you and your partner will give a 
> short presentation for the class in which you describe the problem, 
> discuss any interesting obstacles of problems you encountered in 
> coding the model and how you fixed them (or why you couldn???t fix 
> them), 
> and what you discovered from running the model and doing one of the 
> assigned exercises (see the below for which exercise your group will
> present).
> One partner should present about coding and testing
> the model and the other should present about what you learned from 
> the model

* Your in-class presentation should be 6--7 minutes long, and there will
  be a short time for questions, for a total of 10 minutes.
* For your in-class presentation you should present the answer to one 
  exercise (see the table below), and for your written report, you 
  should include answers to all three of the exercises your team was 
  assigned.

### Written Report

> By the end of the day (before midnight) on Friday October 17, 
> upload a written report to Brightspace on the procedures, results, 
> and interpretation of the textbook exercises associated with this
> project. The report should be a minimum of two pages, double-spaced, 
> in PDF or Microsoft Word format. 
> This is a team project, so you and your partner should work together 
> to write a single report. Any member of the team can upload the 
> report to Brightspace on behalf of the whole team.
> Be sure to give your report a title and include the names of all the 
> authors (team members).
