<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>A hint for exercise 6.3: Patches have integer coordinates (representing the center of the patch). How does the turtle determine the angle to face during <code>setup</code>? How does it determine the angle to face in <code>go-back</code>? Can you think of a different way to record the path so the <code>go-back</code> exactly retraces the path it took during <code>setup</code>? If you knew the direction the turtle was heading at each step during <code>setup</code>, could you use this heading information to exactly retrace the path?</p>
