## Homework

### Homework Exercises:



* You will make a five-minute presentation in class about your model (You can use the full five minutes of talking and there will be an additional two minutes for questions).

### Notes on Homework:


There will not be time to go into all the details in your presentation, so focus on:

## Structure:

#. Start by describing your research question
#. Briefly describe your model
#. Describe the experiments you performed:
   * What outputs did you observe or measure?
   * What parameters did you change?
   * What did you see? (e.g., behaviorspace graphs or screenshots of the model)
#. Conclusions

## General recommendations:

* 5 slides, one minute each.
* As much as you can, use figures (graphs, illustrations, images, etc.) instead of text.
* Avoid slides with a lot of text

You canâ€™t say everything you did, so focus on the most interesting highlights.

You can describe what you did in greater depth in your paper.
