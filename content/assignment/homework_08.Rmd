  * Railsback & Grimm, Ch. 6, Ex. 6.4, 6.5

### Notes on Homework:


You do not need to turn anything in for Exercise 6.2. This is an exercise to try for the experience

A hint for exercise 6.3:  Patches have integer coordinates (representing the center of the patch). How does the turtle determine the angle to face during `setup`? How does it determine the angle to face in `go-back`? Can you think of a different way to record the path so the `go-back` exactly retraces the path it took during `setup`? If you knew the direction the turtle was heading at each step during `setup`, could you use this heading information to exactly retrace the path?
