## Homework

### Homework Exercises:



* Turn in a draft `.nlogo` file with your modified model. The ODD for your modified model should be included in the "Info" section of the model.

  You should _also_ turn in a document that describes what you are satisfied with about your draft model and what problems you are struggling with.

### Notes on Homework:


The model code you turn in should run, but it does not need to be perfect. 
   
The point of this deadline is so that you can check in with me about how
things are going so I can give you feedback and suggestions.

See the project assignment sheet for details.
