<h3>Homework Exercises:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn in a one-to-two page (double-spaced) proposal for your semester research project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>This proposal should describe the topic you want to work on,
identify a published open-source model you want to work with,
and and describe how you think you might want to extend it.</p>
<p>You should consult the textbook, the Model Library in NetLogo,
and the list of reading and computational tools and
resources I distributed on the first day of class (itâ€™s also posted on the
course web site).</p>
<p>If you really want to write your own model instead of working with a
published one, that is also acceptable, but be aware that it may be a lot
more work. I recommend that you do this only if you have previous experience
in programming.</p>
<p>See the semester project assignment for details.</p>
