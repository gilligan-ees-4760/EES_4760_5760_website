## Homework
**There is nothing for you to turn in**, but do the following two tasks to prepare for next week:

* Download NetLogo version 6.0.2 from <https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/> and install it on your computer.
* Set up your Box account. Make a Box folder for your homework for this course (call it `Lastname_EES_4760` (undergraduates) or `Lastname_EES_5760` (graduate students), substituting your own last name), and share it with me, giving me "Editor" role.
