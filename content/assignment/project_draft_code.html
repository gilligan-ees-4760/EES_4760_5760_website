<h2>Homework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Turn in a draft <code>.nlogo</code> file with your modified model. The ODD for your modified model should be included in the “Info” section of the model.</p>

<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>The model code you turn in should run, but it does not need to be perfect.</p>
<p>The point of this deadline is so that you can check in with me about how
things are going so I can give you feedback and suggestions.</p>
