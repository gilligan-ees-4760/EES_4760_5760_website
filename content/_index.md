## Overview

Agent-based and individual-based modeling has become a powerful tool for research in many fields, including
anthropology, civil engineering, computer science, ecology, economics, epidemiology, marketing, medicine,
political science, public policy, robotics, sociology, transportation, and urban planning.

Agent-based modeling is used to study how individual agents (which can represent people, animals, plants, cars, robots,
or packets of information in a communications network) making simple decisions can produce complex and unexpected collective behavior
through their interactions. Agent-based models have been used to investigate racial segregation in American cities,
traffic jams, adaptation to global warming, disease outbreaks, inflammatory response to wound infections,
ecosystem dynamics, impacts of changing land-use on tropical rain forests, political instability, and market penetration of home solar-energy systems.

This course will provide an introduction to agent and individual-based modeling. You will learn how to design,
program, and document agent-based computational models using the free open-source NetLogo environment. You
will use these models scientifically to perform computational experiments and interpret the results.

You do not need to have any prior knowledge of computer programming, but I do expect that you are familiar with basic statistics and algebra.
We will use the NetLogo environment for writing and running agent-based models. NetLogo is a widely used system that is both powerful and
easy to learn, so you can quickly start to program your own models.

## Text

There is one required textbook and one optional one, which I recommend primarily to students
who are interested in social-science applications of agent-based modeling. From time to time
during the term, I will assign supplementary reading on the Internet or in handouts that I will
post to the class web site.

### Required: 

* Steven F. Railsback and Volker Grimm, _Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling: A Practical Introduction_, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition (Princeton, 2019)
  is the primary text for this course. 
  
  There is a [companion web site](<%RAILSBACK_URL%>), where 
  you can download [supporting materials](<%RAILSBACK_URL%>/downloads-errata-2nd-edition/), 
  including design documents, data files, and starter code for models we will
  work on during the term.

  I have also posted the supporting materials on this site, and link to the relevant supporting files from the notes on the relevant 
  [reading and homework assignments pages](/schedule/).
  
  All textbooks have errors. The authors maintain a list of errors that have
  been reported to them and you can read on 
  [the book's web site](<%RAILSBACK_URL%>/downloads-errata-2nd-edition/).
  As of the start of the semester, only two small errors have been reported.


### Recommended (optional):

* Paul E. Smaldino, _Modeling Social Behavcior: Mathematical and Agent-Based Models of Social Dynamics and Cultural Evolution_
  (Princeton University Press, 2023).
  
  This book is optional. Nothing we will do this semester requires this book.
  It is especially recommended for graduate students and students who are interested in applying agent-based modeling to 
  social science and social systems. The book may be especially useful for finding interesting models to work with for 
  your semester research project.
