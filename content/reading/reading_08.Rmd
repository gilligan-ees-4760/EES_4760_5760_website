## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling, Ch. 7.

### Reading Notes:

There is not very much reading for today. Read Chapter 7 of _Agent-Based Modeling_ carefully (it's very short) The point of this chapter is to help you get ideas for your term research project.

Before class, I want you to read through the research project assignment and think about what you might want to do for a research project. We will spend class talking about possible research projects.
