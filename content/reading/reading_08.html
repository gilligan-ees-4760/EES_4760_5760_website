<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>There is not very much reading for today. Read Chapter 7 of <em>Agent-Based Modeling</em> carefully (itâ€™s very short) The point of this chapter is to help you get ideas for your term research project.</p>
<p>Before class, I want you to read through the research project assignment and think about what you might want to do for a research project. We will spend class talking about possible research projects.</p>
