<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>The optional reading from <em>Modeling Social Behavior</em> may be interesting. Chapters 6–7 apply agent-based modeling to game-theory and
chapter 9 looks into social networks among agents in detail.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 focuses on a class of strategic games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma, in which the players
do better when they cooperate with each other, but the game gives each player has a strong tempation
to betray their partner. The chapter investigates a rich line of research, which shows that there may
be reasons for natural selection to favor cooperation, so people may have evolved to be mostly
trustworthy and cooperative.</p>
<p>Chapoter 7 focuses on coordination: The Prisoner’s Dilemma game in chapter 6 looked at people who interact
with a small number of neighbors, whom they can get to know well from experience. This chapter looks at
coordination among large numbers of people, where there is no opportunity to develop that kind of deep
knowledge of your neighbors’ character and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 presents more detail about social networks and the use of NetLogo links.
The main reading from Railsback &amp; Grimm covers the basics of links, but this chapter discusses
the different kinds of social networks (different topologies) that can form using those links.</p>
