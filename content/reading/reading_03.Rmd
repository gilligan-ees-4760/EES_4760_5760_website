## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling, Ch. 2.

### Optional Extra Reading:

* Modeling Social Behavior, Ch. 2.

### Reading Notes:

Familiarize yourself with NetLogo. I recommend that you read through the chapter with NetLogo open on your computer. Feel free to play around with NetLogo and try things out. The homework consists of following the step-by-step creation of a model in section 2.3.

The chapter from _Modeling Social Behavior_  is purely optional. You don't need to read it, and everything you need to know is covered in the reading from Railsback & Grimm, but it may be interesting to read this alternate introduction to the NetLogo modeling system and programming language.
