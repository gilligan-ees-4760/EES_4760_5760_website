## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling, Ch. 2.

### Reading Notes:

Familiarize yourself with NetLogo. I recommend that you read through the chapter with NetLogo open on your computer. Feel free to play around with NetLogo and try things out. The homework consists of following the step-by-step creation of a model in section 2.3.
