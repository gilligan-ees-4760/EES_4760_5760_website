## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling, Ch. 17--18.

### Reading Notes:

You can download [the ODD for the BEFORE beech forest model](/files/models/chapter_18/ch18_before_ODD.pdf), which is described in section 18.3, from the class web site: <https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/models/chapter_18/ch18_before_ODD.pdf>.

I have also posted [a list of published models](/files/models/chapter_18/ch18_ex1_models_list.pdf) in which observed patterns are important: <https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/models/chapter_18/ch18_ex1_models_list.pdf>
