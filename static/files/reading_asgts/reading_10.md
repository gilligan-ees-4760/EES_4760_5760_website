## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling, Ch. 9.

### Reading Notes:

In this chapter, we examine how to detect and record the properties of a model 
that we want to study. 

The article, D. Kornhauser, [U. Wilensky, and W. Rand. (2009). "Design guidelines 
for agent-based model visualization," _Journal of Artificial Societies and Social 
Simulation_ **12**, 1](https://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/2/1.html) 
is available online at <https://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/2/1.html>.

I have posted a [refresher guide](/files/models/chapter_09/ch9_ex8_netlogo_exercises.pdf) 
for NetLogo programming on the class web site at <https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/models/chapter_09/ch9_ex8_netlogo_exercises.pdf>
